# Tanuki-Ext OLED Firmware

Based on commit `93b0bb1` from [kmk firmware](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware).

Using uncompressed version of the [DisplayIO_SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_SSD1306) commit `
4a48127` due to errors in latest stable release causing the rotation function to display random noise on the OLED.
